## Introduction

Danmarks Adressers Web API (DAWA) is a project that exposes Danish address, street, city name, municipality, various geometry, and other data for everyone to search in and download to have their own copy of. DAWA has a couple of API's, one where you can do search queries, and another to replicate data. You can visit their website and read more about them and what kinds of data you have access to via their API's at [http://dawa.aws.dk/](http://dawa.aws.dk/ "Danmarks Adressers Web API").

You can also find DAWA's own client to replicate data via their API, using a Postgres database. You can read more about their implementation at [http://dawa.aws.dk/dok/guide/replikeringsklient](http://dawa.aws.dk/dok/guide/replikeringsklient).
